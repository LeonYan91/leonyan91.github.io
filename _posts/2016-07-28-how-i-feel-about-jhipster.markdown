When in my first company,i am in a project which is using JHipster.It's actually a bit of lucky,that our technology manager(like CTO,but not have such administrator power) is
a person who has enthusiasm in cutting-edge technology.So the project of our company has used plenty of advanced technology in that time(like AngularJs,SpringBoot).

When i first heard about JHipster,my colleague said it's a generator for generate a complete web project including login,homepage,dao,entity,etc, all fronted-end tech and service-end tech
have been seamlessly integrate together,as i said it's already a complete web project,the only thing you need to do is to write your business code,refine it,customize it.I'm shocked
that someone had finally made one.Think about the web project we had made,most of them is so similar,same structure,same technology,and still,every time we build a new project,the process
is still doing the same boring work again,why there isn't anyone who create a generator,generate the entire boilerplate we need,and we can just concentrate on what really varies.

#### Who is JHipster for

Like the name explain in official.J stand for Java,Hipster looking into directory,it means people who is so fashion.
